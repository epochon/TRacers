# 🎓 TRACES  
### Trajectory-Aware Collective System for Student Retention

TRACES is a **trajectory-aware mentoring and support platform** designed to prevent student dropouts by identifying and reducing *bureaucratic and administrative friction* before it becomes irreversible.

---

##  Goal
To build a **personalized, ethical, and AI-powered mentoring system** that supports students beyond academics by addressing financial, administrative, and social challenges early.

---

## Problem Statement
Nearly **40% of student dropouts are caused by administrative and social friction**—such as scholarship delays, fee issues, housing problems, and language barriers—rather than academic failure.

Existing student monitoring systems focus primarily on **grades and performance metrics**, failing to account for cumulative bureaucratic stress. As a result, students often feel overwhelmed and unsupported until they reach a point of no return.

TRACES shifts the focus from performance tracking to **trajectory tracking**.

---

##  Key Features

- **Bureaucratic Friction Tracking**  
  Monitors administrative and procedural hurdles—such as fee delays, policy confusion, and missed formalities—rather than relying only on academic performance.

- **AI Domain-Agent Monitoring**  
  Specialized AI agents continuously monitor key student lifelines:
  - **Financial Agent:** Detects scholarship delays, fee issues, and payment friction.
  - **Academic Agent:** Identifies attendance anomalies, submission irregularities, and engagement drops beyond raw grades.

- **Anonymous Senior Support**  
  Enables students to chat anonymously with seniors, reducing hesitation and fear of judgment while seeking help.

- **Context-Aware Peer Matching**  
  Matches juniors with seniors based on **course, batch, and academic context** to ensure relevant mentorship.

- **Policy-Aware Document Assistant**  
  Assists students in drafting **formal, policy-compliant emails and applications** for:
  - Medical leave  
  - Internship permissions  
  - Fee extensions  
  - Other academic requests

- **Intelligent Academic Calendar Sync**  
  Automatically extracts events from academic calendars (PDFs) and syncs verified dates—such as exams, holidays, and deadlines—directly to **Google Calendar**.

## System Philosophy
TRACES is built on three core principles:
- **Early detection over late correction**
- **Ethical, non-intrusive AI**
- **Human support augmented by intelligent systems**
