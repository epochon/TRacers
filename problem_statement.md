# Project: Traces - Trajectory-Aware Collective System for Student Retention


## Goal
To create personalized Mentoring Platform for Students


## Problem Statement    
40% of dropouts are caused by administrative friction (scholarship delays, housing issues, language barriers), not academic failure.
Current systems track performance (grades), but they don’t track the hurdles that lead to failure as students feel overwhelmed and unsupported until it’s too late.

## Key Features
- Tracks bureaucratic and administrative friction—such as fee issues, policy confusion, and missed formalities—rather than relying only on academic performance.
- Specialized AI Domain Agents continuously monitor key student lifelines:
    Financial Agent: Detects fee delays, scholarship issues, and payment friction.
    Academic Agent: Identifies attendance anomalies, submission irregularities, and engagement drops beyond raw grades
- Enables students to chat anonymously with seniors, reducing hesitation and fear of judgment while seeking help.
- Matches juniors with seniors based on Course,Batch,Academic Context.
- Provides a policy aware document assistant to help students draft formal emails and applications for  Medical leaves,Internship permissions,Fee extensions and other academic requests.
- Automatically extracts events from academic calendars (PDFs) and syncs verified dates—such as exams, holidays, and deadlines—directly to Google Calendar.
